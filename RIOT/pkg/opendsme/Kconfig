    bool "Configure openDSME"
    help
        Configure openDSME using Kconfig.

if KCONFIG_USEPKG_OPENDSME

config OPENDSME_MAX_NEIGHBOURS
    int "Maximum number of DSME neighbours"
    default 20

config OPENDSME_MAX_LOST_BEACONS
    int "Maximum number of lost beacons before assuming the device desynchronized"
    default 8
    help
        Sets the maximum number of lost beacons before the MAC triggers a
        de-association procedure. Higher values are beneficial in noisy
        environments, because the MAC will keep synchronization despite losing some
        beacons. However, lower values are better for mobile nodes, because devices
        may sinchronize faster to a new coordinator.

config OPENDSME_CAP_QUEUE_SIZE
    int "DSME CAP queue size (for CSMA/CA transmissions)"
    default 8
    help
        The CAP queue stores frames to be sent during the Contention Access Period
        using CSMA-CA. Because the transmission delay of CSMA-CA is lower compared to
        GTS transmissions, small values are preferred to reduce memory requirements.

config OPENDSME_CFP_QUEUE_SIZE
    int "DSME CFP queue size (for GTS transmissions)"
    default 22
    help
        The CFP queue stores frames to be sent during the Contention Free Period
        using a dedicated GTS. In contrast to CSMA-CA transmissions, GTS transmission
        take longer as a result of slot schedules. Therefore, the GTS queue should
        have more capacity than the CAP queue (OPENDSME_CAP_QUEUE_SIZE).
