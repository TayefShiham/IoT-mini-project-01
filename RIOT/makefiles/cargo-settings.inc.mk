# Value for CARGO_CHANNEL when using nightly
#
# As different environments have different versions of nightly installed, but
# rustup / cargo does not take "the latest installed nightly" for a toolchain,
# a good value is determined dynamically. Typical values this takes are
# `nightly` (on regular installations) and `nightly-2022-03-08` (or whichever
# date it is currently pinned to) in riotbuild.
#
# Workaround-For: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3015
#
# This does not get evaluated unless actually used; if rustup is not installed,
# the default value will likely not be usable but at least set the user on the
# right track.
CARGO_CHANNEL_NIGHTLY = $(shell rustup toolchain list | sed 's/ .*//' |grep nightly | tail -n1 || echo nightly)

# The Rust version to use.
#
# Examples should set this to either `stable` or `$(CARGO_CHANNEL_NIGHTLY)`.
# The default is empty, which is suitable for applications that select their
# version through a `rust-toolchain.yaml` file.

# Note that if we did not set this explicitly, CARGO_LIB would have to
# understand which value cargo uses in absence of CARGO_TARGET_DIR, which would
# be $(APPDIR)/target.
#
# For many cases, it would be beneficial to base this on BINDIRBASE rather than
# BINDIR, for that would allow different boards using the same CPU to share
# compiled code (unless they they build conditionally on environment variables,
# like riot-sys does). This is not done for two reasons:
#
# * Overriding BINDIR (like is done in Murdock) would not take effect,
#   requiring additional overrides to enable out-of-tree building.
#
# * Switching back and forth between two boards of the same CPU requires
#   riot-sys rebuilds. (On its own, this would be outweighed by the shared
#   compilation of other modules).
