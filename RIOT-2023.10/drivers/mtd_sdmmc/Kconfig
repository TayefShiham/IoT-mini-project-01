    help
        If you have other MTD devices defined, set this number so that
        the auto-configured SD Memory Card(s) or MMCs/eMMCs from
        mtd_sdmmc_default will come after them.

    bool "Enable SD Memory Card erase"
    help
        Enable this to erase sector before a data write operation (SD Memory
        Cards only).
        SD Memory Cards and MMCs/eMMCs handle sector erase internally
        so it's possible to directly write to the card without erasing
        the sector first hence this feature is disabled by default.
