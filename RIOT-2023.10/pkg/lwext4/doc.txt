/**
 * @defgroup pkg_lwext4     lightweight ext2/3/4 implementation
 * @ingroup  pkg
 * @ingroup  sys_fs
 * @brief    Provides a lightweight implementation of the ext2/3/4
 *           filesystem with optional journaling transactions & recovery
 *
 *           Lwext4 is an excellent choice for SD/MMC card, USB flash drive
 *           or any other wear leveled memory types. However it is not good
 *           for raw flash devices.
 *
 *           Some of the source files are licensed under GPLv2.
 *           It makes whole lwext4 GPLv2 licensed. To use library as a BSD3,
 *           GPLv2 licensed source files must be disabled.
 *           To do so, enable the `lwext4_no_gpl` module.
 *           This will disable support for extends and extended attributes.
